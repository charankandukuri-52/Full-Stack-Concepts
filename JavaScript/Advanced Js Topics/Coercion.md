## Coercion

In JavaScript, coercion refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any data type, and JavaScript will attempt to convert values to the appropriate type when operations are performed.

There are two types of coercion in JavaScript:

### Implicit Coercion:

Implicit coercion occurs when JavaScript automatically converts a value from one data type to another without any explicit instruction from the developer.

- This often happens when performing operations involving different data types, such as arithmetic operations or comparisons.
- Examples of implicit coercion include converting a string to a number when using the + operator or converting a value to a boolean in a conditional expression.

### Explicit Coercion:

Explicit coercion occurs when the developer intentionally converts a value from one data type to another using built-in functions or operators.

- This allows the developer to control the conversion process and ensure that values are converted to the desired type.
- Examples of explicit coercion include using functions like Number(), String(), or Boolean() to convert values to numbers, strings, or booleans, respectively.
