/*
let first_name = "Hello";: Here, we're creating a variable named first_name using the let keyword. Variables are like containers that hold information. We're assigning the value "Hello" to this variable. The value is a string, indicated by the double quotes " " around it. Strings are sequences of characters, like words or sentences.

let last_name = 'people';: This line is similar to the previous one, but here we're creating a variable named last_name and assigning it the value 'people'. Again, it's a string, but this time we're using single quotes ' ' to indicate that it's a string. In JavaScript, you can use either double quotes or single quotes to create strings.

console.log('Hi' + first_name + last_name);: Here, we're using the console.log() function to output a message to the console. The message consists of the string 'Hi', followed by the value of the first_name variable, and then the value of the last_name variable. We use the + operator to concatenate (combine) the strings together. So, when this line of code runs, it will print "HiHellopeople" to the console.
